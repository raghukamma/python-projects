JSON & OS libraries

**How to run this program:**
Keep both the files, survey.py & main.py in the same folder and run the command “python3 main.py”

**Hints on how to use various other surveys:**
Currently I have 4 surveys listed (3 commented and 1 active at any time) in the main.py file. Please uncomment/comment the survey files as needed.
